    <h1>White Sauce Pasta</h1>
    <p>This white sauce is also known as béchamel sauce and has it's origin in French cuisine.</p>
    <p>Classic béchamel sauce is made with butter, flour and milk. For this pasta, I add little cream and little cheese
        to make it extra creamy, so you can say that this sauce is kind of a mix between alfredo and béchamel. But you
        can totally skip the cream and cheese and stick with milk only to make the classic version.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>150 grams penne pasta 1.5 cups or use 100 grams pasta for more saucy pasta</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter divided</li>
        <li>1 small red onion diced or chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium red pepper sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sweet corn frozen, I add this to hot water for 10 minutes before using in the recipe</li>
        <li>3/4 cup broccoli florets optional, small florets</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4-5 large garlic cloves finely chopped</li>
        <li>1.5 tablespoon all purpose flour also known as maida</li>
        <li>2 cups milk room temperature, I used whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream optional, you can also use just use milk, cream makes it more creamier</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes</li>
        <li>salt to taste, around 1/2 teaspoon</li>
        <li>black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated cheese optional, you can use mozzarella or cheddar, cheese makes it richer</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How To Make White Sauce </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the pasta according to instructions on the package. I used regular penne pasta which was supposed to be
            boiled for 9 to 11 minutes. and drain. Make sure you don't overcook your pasta, you want it al-dente. Note:
            use only 1 cup pasta if you like more sauce in your pasta. While the pasta is boiling chop all the veggies.
            <p>Once the pasta is boiled, drain it using a colander and set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan on medium heat. Add all the veggies - onion, red pepper, broccoli
            florets and sweet corn. You can use other veggies like carrots, peas as well.
            <p>Cook the veggies for 2 minutes and then remove on a plate.</p>

        </li>
        <li>To another pan or you can use the same pan, now add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the remaining tablespoon of
            butter. Once the butter melts, add the 5-6 chopped garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Then add in the flour. Whisk the flour continuously, using a wire whisk for around 30 to 60 seconds. You
            don't have to brown the flour much.</li>
        <li>Then add in the milk. You can also add 1/4 cup heavy cream here or use additional 1/4 cup milk. Mix
            everything using a wire whisk so that there are no lumps formed.</li>
        <li>Add in the seasonings: Italian seasonings, dried oregano, red chili flakes, salt and black pepper. Mix in
            everything and let the sauce simmer.</li>
        <li>Sauce will thicken as it simmers and in 4 to 5 minutes it will coat the back of the spoon. Turn heat to
            lowest.</li>
        <li>Add in the veggies and the boiled pasta back into the pan. Toss until the pasta and veggies are coated with
            the sauce. Taste test and adjust the seasonings at this point. Serve warm</li>
    </ol>
